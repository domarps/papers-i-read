## Visual Attribute Prediction with Instance Segmentation


- Perform the instance level Segmentation given an image and then perform the attribute prediction on the segmented instances
- Predict the low-resolution heatmap -- then along with the original image, perform segmentation

#### Method

#Step 1 : Instance Level Segmentation 

#Step 2 : Attribute Prediction 

#### Applications

- help improve image search 
- help image captioning (segment objects + predict attributes) 
- improve image tagging with segmentation (ambiguous objects 
- verify correct object label/tag)
