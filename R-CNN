The goal of R-CNN is to identify the main objects present in an image using the bounding box technique. The R-CNN proposes a set of regions in the image and see if any of them actually correspond to an object. This process is known as Selective Search which looks at the image through windows of different sizes, and for each size groups together adjacent pixels by texture, color or intensity to identify objects. The output is the bounding box and labels for each object in the image.
